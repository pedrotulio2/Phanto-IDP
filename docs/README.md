`redux-search` exports the following named assets:

### `createSearchAction(resourceName)`
Factory function that creates Redux search actions. This function requires a single parameter (a `resourceName` string) that identifies a searchable resource. For example:

```javascript
import { createSearchAction } from 'redux-search'

const actions = {
  searchBooks: createSearchAction('books')
}
```

### `getSearchSelectors(resourceName, searchStateSelector)`

Creates selectors for a searchable resource.

##### resourceName
Identifies a searchable resource (eg. 'books')

##### searchStateSelector
Responsible for returning the Search state. A default implementation is provided. Override only if you add `searchReducer()` to the store somewhere other than `state.search`.

For example:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'
import { getSearchSelectors } from 'redux-search'

const { text, result } = getSearchSelectors('books')

const selectors = createSelector(
  [result, books, text],
  (result, books, text) => ({
    bookIds: result,
    books,
    searchText
  })
)
```

### `reducer`

The root reducer for redux-search. It is recommended that you add this to the application state as `search`. For example:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { reducer } from '../src/index'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  search: reducer
  // Your other reducers go here...
})
```

If you add the reducer at an alternate location you will need to supply a `searchStateSelector` to `reduxSearch()` and `getSearchSelectors()`.

### `reduxSearch({ resourceIndexes, resourceSelector, searchApi, searchStateSelector })`
Creates higher-order search store to be composed with other store enhancers.
This function accepts the following named parameters (via a params Object):

##### resourceIndexes:
Maps searchable resources to search configurations. Configurations must be one of the following types:
1. an array of searchable field names (eg. `["name", "description"]`)
2. a custom indexing function (eg. `({ resources: Iterable<Object>, indexDocument: Function })`)

##### resourceSelector:
Selector responsible for returning an iterable resource map for a given, searchable resource. This function should be capable of returning a map for each resource listed in `resourceIndexes`. Its signature should look like this: `(resourceName: string, state: Object): Iterable<Object>`

If this value is specified then the search index will be automatically built/updated whenever resources change. Ommit this property if you wish to manage the search index manually.

##### Search:
Observable Search API. Should only be overridden for testing purposes. Refer to [`SearchApi`](SearchApi.md) for more information if you choose to override this.

##### searchStateSelector:
Selects the search sub-state within the state store. A default implementation is provided. Override only if you add `searchReducer()` to the store somewhere other than `state.search`.

### `SearchApi` / `WorkerSearchAp`
The search API is an observable that manages communication between the `redux-search` middleware and the underlying search utility. It maps resource names to search indicies and coordinates searches. Both a single-threaded implementation (`SearchApi`) and a web-worker implementation (`WorkerSearchAp`) are provided. By default the web-worker implementation is used but you can override this behavior with `reduxSearch()` like so:

```javascript
import { SearchApi } from './SearchApi'

reduxSearch({
  // Configure :resourceIndexes and :resourceSelector here and then...
  searchApi = new SearchApi()
})
```

You may also want to override this value for unit testing purposes. To do so you will need to implement the following methods:

##### `subscribe (onNext, onError)`
Subscribe to Search events. Subscribers will be notified each time a Search is performed.

Successful searches will call `onNext` with the following parameters:
* **result**: An array of ids matching the search
* **text**: Search string
* **resourceName**: Identifies the resource that was searched

Failed searches (searches that result in an Error) will call `onError` with an `Error` parameter.

This method returns a callback that can be used to unsubscribe from Search events. Just invoke the function without any parameters to unsubscribe.

##### `indexResource (resourceName, fieldNamesOrIndexFunction, resources)`
Builds a searchable index of a set of resources. It accepts the following parameters:

* **resourceName** Uniquely identifies the resource (eg. "databases")
* **fieldNamesOrIndexFunction** This value is passed to reduxSearch() factory during initialization. It is either an Array of searchable fields (to be auto-indexed) or a custom index function to be called with a `resources` object and an `indexDocument` callback function.
* **resources** Map of resource id to resource (Object)

##### `async performSearch (resourceName, text)`
Searches a resource and returns a Promise to be resolved with an array of ids that match the search string. Upon completion (or failure) this method also notifies all current subscribers. It accepts the following parameters:

* **resourceName** Uniquely identifies the resource (eg. "books")
* **text** Search string
